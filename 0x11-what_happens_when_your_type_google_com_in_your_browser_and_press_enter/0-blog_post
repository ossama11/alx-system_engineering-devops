# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?

When you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter, a series of complex processes are triggered to render the Google homepage on your screen. This seemingly simple action involves numerous systems working together seamlessly. Here's a detailed explanation of each step involved:

## 1. DNS Request

### Domain Name System (DNS)
The first step is the DNS request. The DNS translates the human-readable domain name (`www.google.com`) into an IP address that computers can understand (`216.58.217.4` for instance). 

- **Local Cache Check:** Your browser checks if it has recently visited the domain and if the IP address is still valid (not expired).
- **OS Cache Check:** If not found in the browser, the operating system's DNS cache is checked.
- **Router Cache Check:** If still not found, your router’s cache is checked.
- **ISP DNS Server:** If none of the caches have the IP, the request is sent to your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) DNS server.
- **Recursive DNS Servers:** If the ISP DNS server doesn't know, it forwards the request to higher-level DNS servers in a hierarchical manner until the IP address is found.

## 2. TCP/IP

### Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
Once the IP address is resolved, your browser needs to establish a connection to the server. This is where TCP/IP comes into play.

- **TCP 3-Way Handshake:** To establish a reliable connection, TCP uses a three-step process called a handshake:
  1. **SYN:** Your computer sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
  2. **SYN-ACK:** The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
  3. **ACK:** Your computer sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server.
- **IP Protocol:** IP is responsible for routing the packets of data from your computer to the server.

## 3. Firewall

### Firewall Check
Firewalls protect networks by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Your request passes through several firewalls:

- **Local Firewall:** Your own computer's firewall checks the outgoing request.
- **Network Firewall:** Your ISP or local network firewall may inspect the request.
- **Server Firewall:** Finally, Google's firewall checks the incoming request to ensure it's legitimate and allowed.

## 4. HTTPS/SSL

### HTTPS and SSL/TLS Handshake
Since the URL uses HTTPS, the connection must be secure.

- **SSL/TLS Handshake:** This involves several steps to establish a secure connection:
  1. **ClientHello:** Your browser sends a ClientHello message to the server, which includes information like SSL/TLS version and cipher suites supported.
  2. **ServerHello:** The server responds with a ServerHello message, choosing the SSL/TLS version and cipher suite.
  3. **Server Certificate:** The server sends its digital certificate to the client, which the client verifies to ensure the server is who it claims to be.
  4. **Key Exchange:** Both parties generate session keys for encrypting the data transmitted during the session.
  5. **Finished Messages:** Both client and server send finished messages to each other, completing the handshake.

## 5. Load Balancer

### Load Balancer
Google uses load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

- **Request Distribution:** The load balancer receives the incoming request and forwards it to one of the many available servers based on the current load, server health, and possibly geographic location.

## 6. Web Server

### Web Server
The web server, typically running software like Nginx or Apache, receives the request from the load balancer.

- **Request Handling:** The web server processes the incoming HTTP request and routes it to the appropriate application server.

## 7. Application Server

### Application Server
The application server hosts the application logic (often in the form of backend code) required to generate the content of the website.

- **Processing Request:** The application server processes the request, which may involve running scripts, querying databases, or interacting with other services.
- **Dynamic Content Generation:** If necessary, the application server generates dynamic content by executing the backend code.

## 8. Database

### Database Query
Often, generating the response requires fetching data from a database.

- **Database Server:** The application server queries a database server (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Google’s proprietary databases).
- **Data Retrieval:** The database server retrieves the requested data and sends it back to the application server.

## Response

### Assembling and Sending the Response
Once the application server has the necessary data:

- **Response Creation:** The application server creates the HTTP response, often containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other necessary resources.
- **Sending Response:** The application server sends the response back to the web server, which in turn sends it back through the load balancer.

## Rendering in Browser

### Rendering the Web Page
Once your browser receives the response, it begins rendering the page.

- **HTML Parsing:** The browser parses the HTML and builds the Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
- **CSS Parsing:** The browser parses CSS and applies the styles to the DOM tree.
- **JavaScript Execution:** If there are any JavaScript files, the browser fetches and executes them.
- **Rendering:** The browser renders the final webpage on your screen.

## Conclusion

Typing `https://www.google.com` and pressing Enter initiates a complex series of events involving DNS resolution, secure connections, firewalls, load balancing, server communication, and data retrieval, all culminating in the rendering of a webpage in your browser. Understanding these steps not only highlights the sophistication of modern web infrastructure but also provides valuable insight into the many technologies and processes that work together to deliver web content seamlessly.

# 🎬 The Great Streaming Slowdown of August 10, 2024

Welcome to the postmortem report of the infamous streaming slowdown incident. Whether you're here to learn from our mistakes or just for some tech drama, we've got you covered!

## Issue Summary

**🕒 Duration of the Outage:**
- **Start:** 2024-08-10, 14:30 UTC
- **End:** 2024-08-10, 16:00 UTC  
(*It felt like forever, but it was actually just 1 hour and 30 minutes.*)

**🍿 Impact:**
- **Affected Service:** Our beloved movie streaming platform.
- **User Impact:** 65% of users experienced what could only be described as "Buffering Hell." Some couldn't even load content—talk about a plot twist!
- **User Experience:** Slowdowns, intermittent access, and, worst of all, missed cliffhangers.

**🔍 Root Cause:**
- Our Nginx server, the unsung hero of content delivery, had a small...okay, a massive memory leak that brought it to its knees. Think of it like Nginx deciding to hoard all the RAM and refusing to share.

## 🎬 Timeline

- **14:30 UTC:** *Alert!* The monitoring system starts throwing a tantrum, alerting us of increased latency and errors. 
- **14:35 UTC:** An on-call engineer, after realizing this wasn't just their coffee machine acting up, confirms the issue and sounds the alarm.
- **14:40 UTC:** Initial investigation begins. We pointed fingers at the database, as always—it was the usual suspect.
- **15:00 UTC:** The database was innocent (*this time*). Our investigation paths were more misleading than a poorly written mystery novel.
- **15:20 UTC:** Light bulb moment! The issue was in the Nginx server logs, where we found the memory leak snickering at us.
- **15:30 UTC:** The DevOps team finally found the culprit—the Nginx caching module. All fingers pointed to it.
- **15:45 UTC:** Called in the senior engineer—the Sherlock Holmes of server configurations.
- **15:55 UTC:** We applied a hotfix, restarting Nginx (*thank you, graceful restart*), and kicked the memory leak to the curb.
- **16:00 UTC:** Service restored! Our users can now get back to binge-watching.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**🔍 Root Cause:**
- The culprit was a memory leak in the Nginx server's caching module, which was supposed to be a trusty helper but turned into a RAM-hoarding villain. This leak caused the server to consume more and more memory until it could no longer handle user requests, resulting in the dreaded buffering and service slowdowns.

**🔧 Resolution:**
- The first step was to restart the Nginx server to temporarily relieve the memory pressure. Next, we disabled the problematic caching module with a hotfix and rolled back to a previous stable version. A permanent fix involved thoroughly reviewing and testing the module before future deployment.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**💡 What We Learned:**
- Our monitoring needs an upgrade to catch these memory leaks before they become full-blown outages.
- Testing updates more rigorously is crucial—no more surprises after deployment.
- Improved documentation and training can help our team spot and fix these issues faster in the future.

**🛠️ Action Items:**
1. **Patch Nginx Server:** Roll back to the stable version of the caching module and apply the hotfix across all environments.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement detailed memory usage monitoring on all servers, with alerts for abnormal behavior.
3. **Rigorous Testing:** Develop stress testing protocols that simulate high-traffic scenarios before deploying updates.
4. **Documentation & Training:** Update internal docs with this case study and conduct training sessions on identifying memory leaks.
